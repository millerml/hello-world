# Extracting text from PDF & Word documents

PDF & DOC files are in binary format, which require special Python modules to access their data. CSV & JSON files are plain text files, which may be viewed in IDLE's file editor. Python also comes with the special csv & json modules, each providing functions to help you work with these file formats. 
CSV stands for "comma-separated values," & CSV files are simpified spreadsheets stored as plaintext files. Python's csv module makes it easy to parse CSV files.
JSON is a format that stores information as JavaScript source code in plaintext files.
